      <h1>What is Tower of Hanoi?</h1>
      <p>
        Tower of Hanoi is a simple puzzle game where you attempt to move a stack
        of increasingly large disks from one peg to another. The catch is that
        you can only move one disk at a time and you cannot put a larger disk
        on top of a smaller disk (i.e., the disks must always be ordered). There
        are three pegs that you can place disks on: one where your tower starts,
        one that is empty, and one where you are attempting to move the tower to.
